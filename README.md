# Scratcher

This project contains an implementation of a scratcher that can be used in Unity. It contains a standalone prefab object
which when dropped in a scene will work immediatly. The scratcher only needs a prizes collection from which it will generate
a random prize.

The prize collection is an asset that can be created from the "Assets" tab just like creating any other asset. It consists of a list of prizes, which in turn are different item assets that can be also created from the assets menu.
