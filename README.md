# Scratcher

This project contains an implementation of a scratcher that can be used in Unity. It contains a standalone prefab object
which dropped in a scene will work immediatly. The scratcher only needs a prizes collection from which it will generate
a random prize.

The prize collection is an asset that can be created from the "Assets" tab just like creating any other asset. It is
consisted of a list of prizes which type is corresponding to the provided Item. Different types of Items can be created
as assets from the "Assets" tab.
